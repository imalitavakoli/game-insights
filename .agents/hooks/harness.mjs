// HARNESSES — and answers it by reading what the harness actually sent, never by
// looking up what a named agent is assumed to do. A per-agent table of event
// names would encode guessed knowledge about contracts we have not verified, and
// a wrong entry would fail silently.
//
// Pure Node, no dependencies. Every export is TOTAL: it returns a value rather
// than throwing, so a hook fails closed instead of crashing the harness.

 * genuinely differ between harnesses, and at least one harness validates the
 * emitted name against the event it was registered on, so a literal there is
 * wrong the moment the registration differs.
 *
 * The SessionStart hooks pass a literal instead, because reading stdin at all

 * previously looked identical, so the second passed unnoticed — precisely the
